This project was initially an exercise in the fundementals of JavaScript. IO, conditionals, data types and their methods, and abstraction. 

Implementing the user interface meant refactoring a lot of the code.  The functional style of programming in the original code made this task a lot easier. This was my first time manipulating the DOM in a meaningful capacity.
